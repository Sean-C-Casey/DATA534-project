# Proposed API

The [Christmas Countdown](https://christmascountdown.live/api) Api. 

*Only 6 different endpoints.*

# Proposed Workflow

After initial architecture setup in the main branch, we plan to branch on features (in this case, our api endpoints to wrap) and merge changes back into the main branch. Changes intended to be immediately accessible by all can be written directly into main.

# Proposed Division of Work
* 6 endpoints split up evenly between 3 partners.
* Initial Architecture setup and organization by Sean
* Continuous Integration / Contributing.md by Gavin
* Final Documentation Details / Vignette by Kevin
