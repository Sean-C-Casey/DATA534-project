# Proposed API

The [Christmas Countdown](https://christmascountdown.live/api) Api. 

*Only 6 different endpoints.*

# Proposed Workflow

After initial architecture setup in the main branch, we plan to branch on features (in this case, our api endpoints to wrap) and merge changes back into the main branch. Changes intended to be immediately accessible by all can be written directly into main.

# Proposed Division of Work

* 6 API endpoints split up evenly between 3 partners.
    * Each member writes tests for their own functions.
* Initial Architecture setup and organization by Sean
* Continuous Integration / Contributing.md by Gavin
* Final Documentation Details / Vignette by Kevin

# Proposed Code of Conduct

* Live fast and die young.
* Get Along
* No whammies.
* *(Sorry Yves, we forgot about this conduct section umtil well after we finished working on the project -- with no problems or friction to note!)*
